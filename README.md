This is a button class I'm working on for future projects. The (single) button class is fully working and funtional. Next on the to-do list is the button set class, this will be a class which manages all the buttons (makes them move in/out of the screen at once, updates them all at once, etc.) and makes it easier to add more buttons. I'm using the SDL core library and SDL ttf library for rendering.
